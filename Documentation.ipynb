    "**1.1** ViTs utilize a **transformer-based architecture**, originally designed for natural language processing, to process image data.  \n",
    "**1.2** This approach divides images into **patches**, linearly embeds them, and processes the sequence using **transformer encoders**, effectively capturing long-range dependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Comparative Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1** The paper contrasts **ViTs with CNNs**, highlighting that while CNNs excel at capturing **local features** through hierarchical structures, ViTs offer a **global receptive field** from the outset.  \n",

    "**3.2** The study discusses strategies like **data augmentation, regularization, and knowledge distillation** to enhance ViT training efficiency and performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Performance Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1** Empirical results indicate that **ViTs achieve competitive or superior accuracy** compared to state-of-the-art CNNs on various **benchmark datasets**.  \n",
    "**4.2** However, this **performance gain** is often contingent on the availability of **extensive training data and computational power**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Challenges and Future Directions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.1** The paper identifies challenges such as **the need for large datasets, high computational requirements, and the potential for overfitting**.  \n",
