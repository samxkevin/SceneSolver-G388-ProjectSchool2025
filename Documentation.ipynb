    "\n",
    "Our **SceneSolver** project leverages **AI-powered crime scene analysis** using **CLIP** and **Vision Transformers (ViT)**. The goal is to **automate forensic investigations** by processing images, identifying crime types, extracting key evidence, and summarizing findings. Below is a structured roadmap to guide the project’s completion.\n",
